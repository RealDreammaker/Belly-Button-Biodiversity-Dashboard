# Plot.ly - Belly Button Biodiversity

##  Background
In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

##  Tasks completed:
  1. Use the D3 library to read the data

  2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

  3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample. `otu_ids` was used for the marker colours (effecting the red and blue main color).

  4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

  5. Gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

  6. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

  7. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
  
  8. App Successfully Deployed to [Github Pages](https://realdreammaker.github.io/Belly-Button-Biodiversity-Plotly/)

All charts are responsive to window sizes
